# localeats:3000

## Description

Wherethelocalsat is an app that allows you to search for the best restaurants that locals frequent.
We used an algorithm that gives you only the restaurants with top ratings that people keep going back to. For this project, we used the [Foursquare API]('http://developer.foursquare.com') to get the restaurants and their checkins and the [Google Maps API]('http://developers.google.com/maps/') to visually show each location on the map.
