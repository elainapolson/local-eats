# localeats:3000

## Description

localeats:3000 is an app that allows you to search for the best restaurants that locals frequent.
We created an algorithm that only returns highly-rated restaurants that the same people keep going back to frequently. For this project, we used the [Foursquare API]('http://developer.foursquare.com') to get data about venue ratings and user checkins, as well as the [Google Maps API]('http://developers.google.com/maps/') to visualize venues on an interactive map.

## Background

This is our first Rails Project at the Flatiron School.

## Usage

Enter in a search query along with a neighborhood to search within, or simply use your current location. Once the results are loaded, a map of all the relevant venues will appear. Click on any of the points to learn more about a certain venue. Explore the city like a local!
