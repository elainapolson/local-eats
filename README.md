# localeats:3000

## Description

localeats:3000 is an app that allows you to search for the best restaurants that locals frequent.
We used an algorithm that only returns the restaurants with top ratings that people keep going back to. For this project, we used the [Foursquare API]('http://developer.foursquare.com') to get the restaurants and their checkin data and the [Google Maps API]('http://developers.google.com/maps/') to visualize each venue on the map.

## Background

This is our first Rails Project at the Flatiron School.

## Usage

Enter in a search query along with either a neighborhood to search within or simply use your current location. Once the results are loaded, a map of all the relevant venues will appear. Click on any of the points to learn more about a certain venue. Explore the city like a local!
